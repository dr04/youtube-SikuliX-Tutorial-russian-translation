00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
Добро пожаловать в сикуликс руководство номер два
Основы 

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,460
пользовательского интерфейса sekulix IDE
и создание первого основного скрипта

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,730
слайд сшоу можно скачать отдельно в описании к видео

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,670
with its own integrated development
environment IDE for short which is

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,720
incredibly powerful with buns you can
click to write the card for you it's not

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,419
everything school X has to offer but
it's very nice forgiveness and novice

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,868
programmers to start learning and have
fun while doing it

8
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:35,700
TX has several different types of things
that can try and match look for when

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,530
it's trying to use its functions we
refer to them as PSM are standing for

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,989
patent string match region and location
this is fairly straightforward but the

11
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:51,839
main one we're going to focus on is the
patent object patents will be the main

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,070
way that he tells the Kodiaks what to
interact with patent object contains

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,929
several pieces of information that we
use in our school the ex programs these

14
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:05,459
are an image the size of the image
similarity value and a target offset so

15
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,769
now you have to remember that its stores
any image

16
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,060
all right let's get on to creating
something let's create a simple

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,728
automation script that opens up the
calculator app and add 1+1 together they

18
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,450
should get a comfortable with the basics
of securely acts right so it's come over

19
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,030
to ask the XID so this is a great idea
looks like and you get this from running

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,950
the run school ext cmd and I just
collects photo a certain stone and you

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,978
up since it depends on May 14 need to
focus on is over here on the left we've

22
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:46,200
got to find find all wait wait vanish
exists and click double click right

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,629
click and drag drop is also a keyboard
actions that you can drop to hit the

24
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,420
drop-down forward just type in the text
on a type of this all start typing keys

25
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,349
on your keyboard type this sucks an
image then tries to text into it and

26
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:06,438
paste texts based things into a
different field alright let's get onto

27
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,419
first we need to go through the steps
that we would go through to open up

28
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,359
after Sir

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,630
I would go down to the start i cant stop
then under the search programs and files

30
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:25,340
our tight calculator calculator and then
enter that would run the calculator and

31
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,759
inside the calculator I wanted to do but
one plus one type 1+1 equals and we get

32
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,659
the answer script has been under so much
in advance to start with but let's give

33
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,430
it a go anyway and you'll find it's not
as hard as it looks right the first time

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,590
I do is win a click this stop so to do
that what we do is click the little

35
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,090
camera icon next to click and then asked
us to select an image on screen click

36
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:03,430
the star icon Stryker bucks over it'll
pop up click the Start icon vest

37
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,439
instruction want to click the INS the
stop button now an interesting thing is

38
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:15,840
that was a delayed for the animation
when you click so you want to make sure

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,830
it waits for this search field so to do
this but we're going to do is going to

40
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,019
use the wait command I'm going to click
through the camera again but this time

41
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,489
I'm you click it we gotta make sure he
quickly click the star concert Quick

42
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,709
Start icon and then we get this section
him and what we do is when I look for

43
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,620
this search so to do this we're going to
drag a box over the whole thing with

44
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,799
this bill I cannot be recognized and
wait for this to come up on screen once

45
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:57,110
it has appeared so we're going to type
some text so we are type type tell

46
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:04,670
clothes quotes + key with a capital K

47
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,289
dark

48
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:13,729
and tough with a capital and so that all
type a calculator to press the key and

49
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:23,719
cool so once thats typed in you want to
wait for the calculated to appear on

50
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:32,440
screen so its open up and did a
calculator calculator image is gonna

51
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:41,160
come over the IDE I'm going to wait and
wait for this calculated to appear on

52
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:51,150
screen so let's just wait to this number
pad to come up there is no wait until it

53
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:56,228
sees a number pad on screen and then
once the notepad there we want to start

54
00:04:56,228 --> 00:05:02,379
clicking buttons let's click click the
camera and we want to click the one

55
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:13,310
button who dragged over the one and then
we want to click the + button drag of

56
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:26,139
the plus and then we want to click one
button again so drag of the one and then

57
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,490
we want to click on the equal sign so
driver the equal sign

58
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,530
all right sir this is our instructions
to run so we're going to click the start

59
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:41,469
button wait until the search pops up
type in calculating calc and press Enter

60
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm gonna wait until the calculator
appears then click 1+1 equals and yeah

61
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:55,408
that's it should run actually get a redo
this a cosine that looks like my mouse

62
00:05:55,408 --> 00:06:01,259
is hovering over top so we just delete
things back spacing and we want to click

63
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,478
again and wait for the images pop up and
then I'm gonna try over the top of this

64
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:13,408
a cosine make sure that the correct
awesome so let's give it a shot so we're

65
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:18,430
going to save this as we need say but
before he can run it so it can look at a

66
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,629
photo I'm gonna

67
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:27,170
domestically X folder and might even
create a subfolder called scripts so

68
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:36,720
inside the scripts photo we're gonna
save it so thats kool let's call it out

69
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,980
calc but that's gonna save it and
renamed up here in those show you where

70
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,420
it's stored and make it run so I'm gonna
close the calculator because otherwise

71
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,230
it will cause issues and that's it run
run it'll take over and start automating

72
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:06,069
as you can say I mean it to a script has
ended its run all successfully we have a

73
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:13,659
look at it and given us the answer to
what now it's interesting to see how

74
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,760
school exs storing the information that
we give it let's have a look at how you

75
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,959
might start to figure out how
schoolyards works plus it might

76
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,419
highlight an issue with our efficiency
rights over come back over to a folder

77
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,870
where restoring files so we created the
scripts folder called a calc so it's

78
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,009
inside here we noticed that it's got an
image for each one of those screenshots

79
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:41,829
that he took it is a little insufficient
especially when these two identical

80
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,919
images

81
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,650
all right sir we can also see that
there's a calcutta HTML file and a calc

82
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:56,560
top I file so we can open things up so I
could step up and say see motile up in

83
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,209
my head up and you can say it's just a
bunch of HTML occurred with the names of

84
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:10,779
curt and I pictures and this is what
school years is to make this images in

85
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:16,469
the editor so this is a text email
however the card that actually gets run

86
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:24,130
we can close this folder is the pie
files in this back this up in Petoskey

87
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:29,329
us we can see some cardio search inside
this current budget cuts and click on

88
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:33,000
image to click and all these functions
who can too

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,269
securely to serve as you can see we do
have some deficiencies with these

90
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,079
tickets and I think it could be made
much more efficient ok so now that we

91
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,850
have no idea about how to co-exist
storing images in separate files let's

92
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,259
talk about the last two features of a
pat similarity and target offset

93
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:00,740
currently we haven't taken advantage of
these two features as we've just use the

94
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,769
basic image image selection similarity
is a decimal value between 0 and one but

95
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:12,840
it's actually a percentage for example
0.5% similarity you can think of a

96
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,970
sensitivity 50% be something about 50%
the same as what you looking for click

97
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:25,259
that if a similarity 0.1% if we find
anything that looks about 10% the same

98
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,330
as what we're looking for click it then
we have target offset simply this is the

99
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,790
point to click on the image is the dayy
DAX offset from the center of the image

100
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,449
this will be immediately obvious once we
have a look at it

101
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,710
all right let's modify a script to use
less than half the images were used

102
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:51,150
before by using offset will also have a
fiddle with similarity alright let's

103
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:57,889
come back over to guard him so we don't
need to change out first thing we

104
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:02,500
definitely when I click the Stop button
and we didn't want to such talk but we

105
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,980
can start to change this weight section
here so what we can do is let's remove

106
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:17,289
these images were gonna get rid of that
that that that you get rid of all of

107
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:25,860
this I'm going to reset up a calculator
so far back up inside a calculator we

108
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,190
noticed that the plus the one the plus
and the Eagles bonds are all in this one

109
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:41,800
section of the area so we can do is
reaching our wait for this section to

110
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:48,519
appear on screen so this section has all
of the things that we need in it and

111
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,629
what we can do is we can grab the image
copy it

112
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:59,389
beacon type click open brackets based in
our image and clothes blankets then we

113
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:00,490
can click on this image

114
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,459
I'm gonna tell we can have a look at a
matching PVC this is a similarity to

115
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:13,269
inside the similarity can see that the
more I start to make it similar to more

116
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:19,110
objects appear on screen shots to get
pretty ridiculous so wanna keep that a

117
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,720
relatively high sensitivity rates are
around 75% to me when you look at Target

118
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,180
offset so inside a target all set we can
tell it where we want to click so what

119
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:36,029
we can do is we can say hey click the
one button so you just click inside of

120
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,319
an image and all set to upset the bottom
that place on the image

121
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,120
apply an OK and you see it has a
similarity up the top corner and a

122
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,899
little red mark pointing to where to
click on the image you can rinse and

123
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:56,179
repeat this so i cant i click click
button just put in a Dodge image to

124
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:01,689
remove it and paste it on your image
click on that and then we want to go to

125
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,990
a target all set the next hearing it
plus another plus section of the image

126
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:15,549
it apply ok make it up a click again a
star image close up the bracket press

127
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:21,429
one again we could have really copied
that other than other kurds from up

128
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:26,000
there but what does he do it and we can
talk click one more time

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,860
place tonight image was it off target
offset to the equals button this time

130
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:40,669
reply ok all right so now we're using
the same image four times so actually

131
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:47,099
cutting total program in half so if we
save this get back to follow him you

132
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,870
notice that we've only got three me just
now got the stop button

133
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,089
the search button and the calculated
area and if we run it closed the

134
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:05,430
calculator fast now if we run it hit run
and start typing coke

135
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,879
calculator an era

136
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:20,740
region cannot be felt

137
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,110
struggling to find the image let's give
it one more shot or rayon it start calc

138
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,000
Evans up did find it

139
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,220
respond plus one equals so I don't know
what they're there was maybe took too

140
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,560
long to open up so we send that it
worked I'm were used to top the amount

141
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:46,699
of images making out much much smaller
cool ok that's it for this video I'm

142
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,649
sure you can already feel the parody
fingertips the next thing we'll be

143
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,940
looking at is conditional automation you
have any questions leave it in the

144
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,580
comments and I'll try to answer as best
as possible don't forget to subscribe

145
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,570
thanks for watching
