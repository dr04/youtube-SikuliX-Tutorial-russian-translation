00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,190
reacts to tour number five game example
in this video will create a simple

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,289
automation scripts to play the game
quickly heroes I picked this game

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,689
because smaller download on Steam or
even played a browser it's also fairly

4
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:18,649
simple to understand the basics
everybody have all slideshows anchored

5
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:23,219
available in the description before we
start important to talk about the low

6
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,799
level interaction functions physically X
this is important because when you click

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,560
faster than the Cliq function can but we
may as well look at other low-level

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,689
functions are available

9
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,808
mass down but so click down the
specified button mouse up which have a

10
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:43,738
button is specified will unlock the bun
no bun specified all buttons mouse move

11
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,718
will move the mouse to a specified place
in a patent for a location or

12
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,640
alternatively a specific place from its
composition specified as an X&Y offset

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,989
we hope will scroll the mouse within a
specified patent or location either up

14
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,358
or down and takes a number of steps on
the mouse with scroll down works just

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,850
like mass down however you can also put
a list of buttons to press down at time

16
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:12,030
t up actually takes a key goal list of
case if not specified Okies are the

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,269
least important to keep in mind

18
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:19,060
automation is a very iterative process
that often have to tweak and pull your

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,909
script in different directions to combat
unforeseen issues such as the tooltip

20
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,590
that appears after the masses been
hovering over bun may throw your image

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,689
recognition of the key thing to remember
is don't get to enjoy the script doesn't

22
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:37,139
work try or even on the 10th try alright
let's get into the example we won't be

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,939
spending hours on the script so well on
the ultimate three aspects of the game

24
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:44,250
clicking the monsters upgrading heroes
and moving on to the next time

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,549
alright so to come over to have a look
at how it works so this is the basic

26
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:56,960
game starts when you create a new game
of sixty years on the right here we have

27
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,779
the little monsters that you click into
damage to a new click them in their

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,960
health goes down and when they die you
pick up goals you can spend that golden

29
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,679
upgrades which is your heroes over here
on the left which will respond and

30
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,000
continue cooking

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,389
plating gold and then spending their own
your heroes are killed five year i mean

32
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:24,739
say that an upgrade becomes available
over here and you can click on that and

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,260
a lot of great and then you start doing
more damage than I'm going to damage

34
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:34,269
Berkeley and this continues until all of
the monsters in the zone have been

35
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:41,969
killed so here we have a doubt 1010 1010
area complete seeking continue doing

36
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:48,129
things here if you want to move on to
the next Sun indexes and provides strong

37
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:59,280
enemies and moco drops so you continue
collecting gold and leveling up yours is

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:10,629
continues on as you can see it's quite a
repetitive task until all of the enemies

39
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:19,729
in these aren't I killed and then we can
move on to the next one to notice that

40
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,560
when those enemies in a baby killed
there's this little skull icon here with

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,549
a zero to 10 which will come in handy
for knowing when way we can move on to

42
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,469
the next on show in a zone what we've
completed there's no school and when we

43
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:42,000
can upgrade the icons this light blue
over this doctor alright so now that we

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,810
know how it works

45
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,469
let's give it a reset and will start
running out for alright cool

46
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:54,469
ok the first thing I want to do is to
make a certain amount has not moved away

47
00:03:54,469 --> 00:04:04,210
so we're going to care settings don't
move mouse to play

48
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:10,790
equal to zero points there is no delay
and I'm gonna create a running variable

49
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:17,449
which I'm gonna title hot cake n ice
cube is running running equals true

50
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:23,670
capital T and when I create some
variables to keep track of things that

51
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:34,810
are happening in game so let's have a
should click says he gonna be the number

52
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,530
of clicks to do before we check if there
needs to be any upgrades done let's have

53
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:49,049
a should should I upgrade there's gonna
be a true when we went to operate but

54
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,040
for those that off as false as there
isn't anything to upgrade when the game

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:02,040
starts and we'll have a variable called
time to bed which will keep track of how

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,640
many upgrades that we can do before we
can't do any upgrades so this will keep

57
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,459
track of loosely keep track of how fast
we're killing things and whether we

58
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:24,000
should move up to the next area most of
that off with alright so now let's

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:39,189
define a hotkey callback functions death
run cookie and we pass in the event you

60
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:48,790
want how global running and we want to
set running to the cool false

61
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,720
capital F ok now if created a Kovach
let's

62
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,010
ok environment env

63
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:07,920
had what key and we're going to the key
. f1 again same as last time an alchy

64
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,340
modifier going to be control again

65
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:23,849
easy to use and then have functions are
run but he added that lets get how

66
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,210
quickly here as winter so to do this we
gonna use a new function codes which apt

67
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,430
so returns the window so I'm gonna call
it see hates is going to be a clear

68
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,530
winner

69
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:45,859
eco switch capital any pipi to switch
cap no change color inside the Audi and

70
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,330
we're going to search for the app click
here as I believe it's called so the

71
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:55,810
name of the winter cold could hear the
capital C and Hayden has a space in 2008

72
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,990
so quick

73
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:08,500
space heroes postcards so now that we've
switched the app we can do a while so

74
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:19,180
while now she hates to cook cooking
years . has windows so while the window

75
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:32,430
visible for years and we're running I'm
going to repeat occurred right the first

76
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,519
thing we want to do is we want to click
because the game revolves heavily right

77
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:46,919
clicking the first thing we want to do
so would do if I should click for so

78
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,439
very well for is greater than those
clicks but we still need to do then

79
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:02,540
we're going to have actually what we'll
do is just click of a button click the

80
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,879
home button and we want to have over
something that we can use to click on so

81
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,750
we work on these enemies here but this
ground changes and if you remember when

82
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,410
clean through before the grand changes
to different patterns so we can't really

83
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,939
pick anything on this ground here to try
the health public health also changes so

84
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,420
what's something that doesn't change in
this area but we've got the mute button

85
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:35,029
down so if we have a muted or muted we
can keep it muted and select this area

86
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,379
here

87
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,669
unchanging throughout the whole the
entirety of the game so it will fit this

88
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,799
area and then will offset it from that
and click on the screen and we will see

89
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:52,469
how it goes now so we want to have one
suspect but struggled over a mute button

90
00:08:52,470 --> 00:09:00,529
yeah we know what we want to do is be
want to check its similarity and set a

91
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:07,019
target I'll set it up to a matching
preview and we can see its matching

92
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,000
twice down here so we want to bump up a
similarity is made so it's only being

93
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,620
shown once again so I gotta at a value
of 86 percent similarity it apply all

94
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:27,100
set and as you can see was Indian in
high detail down here the button with

95
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,889
the scroll wheel and we want to click on
the enemy so when I click around here so

96
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:37,610
a massive offset from a button but we
know that this money I'm gonna move out

97
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:46,360
so it always look on the enemy by ok
with that setup

98
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,759
hovering over the top of our enemy you
know that I masses hovering over the top

99
00:09:52,759 --> 00:10:04,090
of the enemy we can start clicking so
while should click for is greater than 0

100
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:16,570
and and running so here's a running the
bailout if I'm it clicks we are going to

101
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,590
mass

102
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:28,830
down to the capital D the capital B
button . capital L EFT so again I click

103
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:36,440
down the left mouse button close-up of
brackets then we're going to mass now

104
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,130
left button said button

105
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:43,120
. left and left us all in capitals

106
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,429
all right click the mouse down months
and lifted the mouse button up we can

107
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:57,250
say that was quick runs so should click
for can now minus equal one so we can

108
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,049
remove one from the total amount of
clicks and that will allow all linked to

109
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:11,370
end so outside of that while now we're
going to go back to a fast if mine and

110
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,220
this time we're going to do

111
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:24,009
time to dead check and whether we should
move on to the next area sir if time to

112
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:34,069
head is greater than or equal to two so
if we are able to upgrade twice without

113
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:45,460
missing an upgrade quick psycho and not
exists and thing that we want to check

114
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,850
if it doesn't exists

115
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:56,370
take a screenshot of clothes blankets
and clothes them and yes thing we want

116
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,110
to check for is that skull so we're
going to take a screenshot I'm gonna

117
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,759
pick the skull and because the back
banks can change we're going to try and

118
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,629
stay inside the confines of the skull
and get enough detail that we can pick

119
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:15,570
it out later on but they're still image
of the skull him he wanted to make sure

120
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:22,140
that we definitely have the skulls
similarity matching preview showing up a

121
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,230
couple of times even getting picked up
here against to clients who want to

122
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,950
boost up that similarity to maybe
something around 88% by

123
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,360
we don't need to do anything about it so
upset because we just need another

124
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,190
exists

125
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:45,460
alright so now that we've got that if
statement because collin next line and

126
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:56,110
now we want to click Next Next area so
we're going to click and the next area

127
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,789
appears next to the center of current
area so something that doesn't change is

128
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:09,649
this our purpose here on the right to
put this in coming to check its matching

129
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:15,289
some similarity picking up the other
direction as well so its first set up so

130
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:22,860
it's only getting the one side 85% by
target all set and resume out again with

131
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:29,110
the scroll wheel and we want to pick the
next concern along for mac online so we

132
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,440
want to click in this empty space here

133
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,360
fly ok so now we've got a click setup
this so click and move on to the next

134
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,800
area when we move on to the next area we
want to make sure we set out time to

135
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:52,209
head back to their and up to the next
area when when there's no enemies left

136
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:57,090
tackle in this area right so come back
to help us if line again for a little

137
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,750
bit of white space in their little bit
easier aid if and we're going to do it

138
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,070
just for an upgrade now so before I like
aids with the check that had decided to

139
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,020
be a highlight of Blues so we're gonna
need to play our game a little bit you

140
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:23,389
click on a few times get out first
upgrade available right now that we've

141
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:30,610
got an upgrade available we can now try
and match that if exists

142
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:37,639
little screenshot here and I want to
select a sketch of this bit of this and

143
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,000
we don't want to get the coins because
the coins will change so let's get to

144
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,789
see eg 0

145
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:53,139
little blue section him and if it does
exist to make sure simpson similarities

146
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,590
alright

147
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:03,389
open that up a few matches going on so
that boosted up a bit to say haiti's 88%

148
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:18,980
by ok so if that exists then we won a
set should I upgrade to true so we're

149
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,940
now setting out should I upgrade to
search and once we know that we should

150
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:35,190
upgrade we're going to click click click
but it up during the massive delay that

151
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:47,010
you click the Upgrade button who are
slick same copy pasted that actually

152
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:57,899
might do that in fact copy paste image
from up here they said in so every save

153
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,990
up in space

154
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,840
maxis correctly yep I mean to say that I
offset somewhere in the middle button

155
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,210
make sure the way we're hitting it right
so quickly and upgrades that will

156
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:18,139
upgrade and we want to set out time to
Dead two plus two equals one so we were

157
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:26,059
able to upgrade successfully and there
wasn't any missed upgrades

158
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:34,559
up on me when I set out clothes for this
statement

159
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,709
else colon

160
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,160
if the pattern was to not exist for the
upgrade then we want to tell it to

161
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:49,899
either set the time to time to deadly
kozyrev there is no upgrade if it does

162
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:56,439
exist did exist at some point then we
want to set our clocks back up and said

163
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:06,450
I upgrade to false alright so if not
should I upgrade so if it didn't exist

164
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:15,170
after doing a spatter beauty clinics and
we want to set our time to head to equal

165
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:20,740
there're so we failed to achieve an
upgrade in the amount I'm bookmarking

166
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:32,180
and will said I should upgrade to echo
thoughts after that so there wasn't any

167
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,970
upgrades existing you want to set to
FALSE then we want to set our should

168
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:45,900
click for 250 and her back up to 50
times alright so this should be enough

169
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,350
for us to start seeing how things are
working so let's save this call it click

170
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:55,769
click Save

171
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,069
we're going to click on the enemies
until there's none left in the burned or

172
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:07,950
until his upgrades available and let's
give it a shot so saved from the start

173
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:16,390
clicking will do its 50 clicks and might
lose a few clicks here on that just to

174
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:24,120
leave because of its interaction with
the game and i mean upgrade

175
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:27,859
like we've got a similarity issue I'm
trying to upgrade things that an

176
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:36,678
upgradeable so it's Kontrol f1 and have
a look at what it might be

177
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:43,960
ok so the issue was that the image that
I was trying to find two similar to the

178
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,139
one selected image so let's say this I
just freaked recapture the image using a

179
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:57,079
little bit more background so let's give
this a shot instead rerun

180
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:11,918
click and wanted guns clicking should I
upgrade to upgrade again as it still

181
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,749
available by clicking must have missed
it when I was doing its hopes relations

182
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:31,669
stunts clicking the area's complete
upgrades grades are all done should

183
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:37,519
moves to the next area which already has
done and that's pretty cool so we've got

184
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:45,019
a lot of what he now it's clicking and
it's doing it's upgrading and going back

185
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:51,359
to clicking ones not grades to do I'm
moving on to the next one is two one

186
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,648
problem with that book currently

187
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:58,589
probably fall on its head in the next
area possibly on the next on the level

188
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:02,769
10 zone and this is because every five
levels in clicking here is this a boss

189
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:09,298
has a timed clicking event which means I
but needs to be out of killing quick

190
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:14,269
enough to be a move on to the next time
I'm doesn't then ok but keep repeating

191
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:17,929
the same thing over and over again which
will get a stuck in a loop but we can't

192
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:23,740
win so we need to build that into our
system so as you can see the time going

193
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:30,859
down now in the middle of the game and
we're not doing enough damage actually

194
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:38,798
might actually be doing enough damage to
be at this time however as you said

195
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:47,519
times going down and running out of time
and we don't get to kill it in time

196
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,839
probably 10 times up it keeps repeating
over and over again I'm gonna get stuck

197
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,779
in a loop so we need to combat this when
there's a bus visible we need to make

198
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,730
sure we can go back to the previous
level if we haven't upgraded enough

199
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:13,759
rights and the script hell yeah I mean
to put in a bus check so I'm gonna come

200
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:20,690
up here and create another variable
coach bus and bus going to start a false

201
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:28,320
and down the very bottom when we're
checking out often or upgrades exist and

202
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,500
we're talking again we're going to put a
check in to make sure there's no bus or

203
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,690
there is the bus we should click for
longer or go back to a previous level if

204
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:47,670
we're not able to kill a quick enough
right so if exists just again but it

205
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:54,450
exists screenshot and we want to capture
this clock he also want to try and stay

206
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:04,330
inside the edges of the clock and keep
an update how that we can match to it so

207
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:12,990
if the clock exists it does I met you
preview pretty similar I was buffed up

208
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:26,808
two studs to make sure it around 90% why
so if it exists and it's not currently

209
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:40,808
boss demi 12 said should click for eco
hundred and fifty quicks three times and

210
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:46,548
no amount which should be enough to take
out a boss in terms of a share and then

211
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:51,619
we're gonna set out boss variable to
equal true with a capital T

212
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:56,939
alright we want and I'll if

213
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:19,440
else if exists how fast i'ma bust time
and its similarity that exists and we

214
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,690
want to do you al

215
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,798
go back to levels are unable to kill the
bus and we've run out of clicks then we

216
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:34,509
want to go back to the previous low to
get stronger so we're going to click and

217
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:38,720
we want to copy how click from the
foreword by clicking on the Next Iron

218
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:48,528
Man copy this whole line actually come
down to where we're clicking and this

219
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:52,868
time we want to change where the target
of cities so instead of clicking on the

220
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:59,949
right hand side back on the left to go
back to level ply ok so once you've

221
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,649
clicked the bus to go there are no
longer on the bus level and the previous

222
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:11,959
alright so this should keep going over
to get strong after defeat the boss but

223
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:19,429
save this and come back two years and
then go back to the previous sign them

224
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:29,929
over now script so hit run the sense
that clicking

225
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:37,649
should upgrade and then she moves up to
the next level to be a bus level it

226
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:45,089
should at least have his grades won't be
strong enough so we need to get to

227
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:51,019
upgrades in a row of clicking before we
can go up to the next Sun so that

228
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:58,929
upgrade should take it to the next Sun
Sweden fail I'm on the bus should

229
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:15,820
preprocessing that our bus 150 times

230
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:23,480
we defeat the bus this time and continue
fighting it on the next time you get all

231
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,410
out cold though try upgrading and should
move on to the next Sun should we have

232
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:37,779
failed however it would have moved back
to the previous son how to move the

233
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:44,829
stuff to the next Sun cuz we haven't
gotten to upwards so this may pose a

234
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:52,369
possible issue depending on how come
back his own things that were not fit

235
00:25:52,369 --> 00:26:09,250
enough to achieve getting stronger

236
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:19,210
up to the bus

237
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:24,950
anyway start to get the point should
continue to repeat this process until we

238
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:31,980
move through the game called so I ended
here and that's a script completed

239
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,919
awesome ok that's it for this series I
