00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,799
welcome to school Exeter number three
additional automation in this video we

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,730
look at some of the fancy important
output to securely access gives us and

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,099
also will look at selection in patent
that allows us to a conditions to

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,329
Asakura scripts everybody have all
slides is anchored available no

5
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:21,528
description interacting with the user
can be quite important and is a great

6
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:25,469
way for us to her now conditional
automation skills you in school yikes

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,608
ever its previous versions is some nice
Gy pop-ups that can give information to

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,989
the user or receive information from
them

9
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:38,509
sex scandals this really well and is as
simple as it gets to use alright let's

10
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:43,179
look at the six functions available to
us the first three output boxes will pop

11
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:47,140
up which does exactly that sounds
created dialogue with extra give it an

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,409
optional title as well as an OK button
that will close it we have pop era which

13
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:58,238
is like a public however shows areas and
alongside the text we then have asked

14
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,959
which is the public once again rise the
user with a yes or no decision we can

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,629
then used to determine what we do from
that the second half input pups which

16
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:12,670
allows to receive input from the user of
the script the input function will give

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,909
a simple input box with an OK and Cancel
buttons we can also optionally give this

18
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,700
window a prompt such as what is your
favorite number we can also optionally

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,519
give it a default answer an optional
title for the window and we can

20
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,509
optionally said hidden tutored turning
into a possible hiding input characters

21
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,560
we then have input text which works
similar import covers a much bigger

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,900
bucks and can be customized to be even
bigger in size

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,280
finally we have select which is my
personal favorite provide the public

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,719
with a drop down and the user can select
from a list of options we provide such

25
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,170
as whether there was to add subtract
multiply or divide alright let's give

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,259
these you are boxes are trying to get
comfortable so we can use them later in

27
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:59,700
a decision-making so we come over to
securely and let's try tried out so

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,539
creative a variable code name so quickly
named I'm gonna make that echo input

29
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:15,679
open parenthesis in courts were gonna
put up now text that we want to put in

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:24,290
the input sir and your name being closed
up the quotes and closing parenthesis

31
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:31,408
and then let's use the pop-up

32
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:39,218
pop-up function in a print disease and
we're going to acquire its color and

33
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:47,039
then we're going to add on the named the
end name.com are making title the box

34
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,158
below

35
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,638
you give the national title which will
make the proper called heller and it'll

36
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,930
say hello to the name that was ended
previously alright let's try out input

37
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,000
text field so who do some text as a
variable in Astoria last text

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,979
echo input input text with a capital T

39
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:25,019
pregnancies and text quotes close
princes and then that's proper Panera

40
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,579
and will pop out the Sun text service

41
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:42,689
era through and apparel do close courts
and the some tax return to the end

42
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:49,530
rights that should give us a good look
of opera does right now let's try out

43
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,609
the select input type so first we need
to create a couple of options so my

44
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:02,099
options can be a variable named go to
store all in my options with heparin

45
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:09,869
equals open up parentheses and in courts
which one was the first option is coming

46
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,009
to includes

47
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:25,668
three words for you cards come up and
500 closed up a parenthesis and we have

48
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:34,228
a couple of options let's now stop the
result of what the user pics so it is

49
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:41,519
going to be what these pics with the
select dropdown because select and

50
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:50,519
inside the Select were going to tell
them pick a number and then we're going

51
00:04:50,519 --> 00:05:02,459
to set the options for a select to echo
my options because of a parenthesis cope

52
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:08,279
right now we can use the Pope asked
output and what this does is it gives

53
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:14,079
them a yes or no answer and we can store
that yes or no answer inside of a

54
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:22,750
variable so call a verbal choice that's
gonna equal prop ask and inside here we

55
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:31,779
can say did you select and then we can
add on the number that they'd like to

56
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:38,189
return result a simple question mark on
the end

57
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:44,978
closed off that since you asked him did
you select the result they previously so

58
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:52,250
should be yes but just illustrate how it
works in commercial pilots get the save

59
00:05:52,250 --> 00:06:00,519
and call it an important test

60
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,829
saver and its leaders

61
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:14,848
runs on a popup saying enter your name
so it's jobs ok then we get a popup that

62
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:20,680
says he'll address and the title of it
is however as we set up and then we've

63
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:31,379
got our textbooks so this is some text
so let's and doesn't text you today and

64
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,860
then hit enter a title he doesn't text

65
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,280
ok and we get asked all the era so this
is now peres type says hello how are you

66
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,269
today so don't make much sense but we
have to see how it works and then we get

67
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:52,189
a SELECT statements got a list of
options

68
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:59,930
12345 so you can pick a number so that's
good for me OK and then we've got asked

69
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:08,228
asked says did you select for a yes or
no other than to say yes and a program

70
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:13,500
finishes so if we wanted to we could do
it another popup that says whether they

71
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:23,959
said yes honor for the pop ask but we
just move on from here to right now 12

72
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,908
selection I'm going to try and move over
this pretty loudly as I did recommend

73
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:32,759
some basic plot no programming
experience ok so that makes decisions we

74
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,150
use the if statement it allows it to
check if an expression is true or false

75
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:44,068
if it's true we do something otherwise
FALSE we've done important to notice the

76
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:48,689
palestinians intends to decide when kurt
is inside of it if statement this could

77
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:54,430
be a single space just a one time with
four as it makes it easier to read also

78
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:03,028
note the colon on the end of the line to
expect intend on the next line now these

79
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:06,110
expressions we check result in either
true or false

80
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,218
for this we have comparison operators we
can check if somebody's equal or

81
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,990
something is not equal began taking
things for granted

82
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,079
less than etcetera a place to couple of
examples at the bottom here five is less

83
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,490
than those ten is greater than or equal
to 10 is true

84
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,790
five is equal to one is false and you
can solely place true or false

85
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,259
as an expression and it will work all
right now we know how to use the if

86
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,960
statement let's look at two other
statements that go hand in hand with

87
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,759
this statement is that on to the end of
the F sort of the expression is church

88
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:49,100
do something else if it's both do this
instead it's fairly simple finally if

89
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,220
statement the statement allows it to
check another expression if the first

90
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,180
one was falls so if true do something
else if this is church do something

91
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:58,909
different

92
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:03,889
house do this instead we can combine as
many elephants in one if statement as we

93
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:04,559
like

94
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,699
ok now finally back to some scripting
let's create a calculator automation

95
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,240
again this time however will ask the the
beginning if they wish to add subtract

96
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,100
multiply or divide also to mix it up
let's use the number five instead of one

97
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:26,769
right so we come back to school here and
will create a new document includes all

98
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:31,949
right so we wanna ask them if they want
to add subtract multiply and divide

99
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:39,270
let's special am so create a variable
called modes not gonna equal couple of

100
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:47,990
of us options so I first one can be had
for words come up and we can do some

101
00:09:47,990 --> 00:10:01,519
clothes guards come up quotes moll
multiply and divide words close up at

102
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,149
Apple alright so goddamn words let's now
ask the use of what they were 11 under

103
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:15,669
so called a result option and options
can echo select to any used to select

104
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:17,528
winner

105
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:29,730
what would you like to question mark and
then passing out options is going to eat

106
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:36,188
cool emergence was up a parenthesis
certainly we've got from the user book

107
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:44,028
what kind of action they want to do the
arithmetic know we can continue doing

108
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:58,259
what we did last to do so click the Stop
gun so let's use the Quick stopped on 70

109
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,699
could stop by them you wanna wait for
the such but that's just copy from the

110
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:21,058
last the last one so it's not copy wait
type the same copy I'll wait really

111
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:26,278
titled pasted in so we're going to click
the start button

112
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,679
we're going to wait for the search
button come up we're going to typing

113
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,469
calc and press the Enter key I'm going
to wait for the calculator a popup once

114
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:51,480
calculated popped up we can click the
five buttons copy right click

115
00:11:51,480 --> 00:12:03,820
click out a calculator and we want to
click click on this and target upset me

116
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:11,350
five button to apply ok so now we're
cooking the five button and now we can

117
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,550
start writing out if so this is what we
choose but we're going to add subtract

118
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:23,629
multiply or divide so if if option so
the option that they use a slight to the

119
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:32,179
star is equal to double double equal
sign words

120
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:39,719
square brackets is there a close call
back its so if the option they selected

121
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,370
was able to the first married to weaken
semicolon Collins aren't going to call

122
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:54,278
in to go down to the next line and if so
then we're going to click and copy of

123
00:12:54,278 --> 00:13:04,789
previous line to click and we're going
to click on the target offset of the

124
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,860
plus symbol so we're going to add a
reply

125
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:17,019
take pictures to add going to add never
came back out to the first line and do

126
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:22,339
so we're going to be checking again with
another if statement the first one was

127
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,449
full so they didn't choose I'd be going
to check with the option is able to

128
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,629
merge

129
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:36,309
square bracket 100 square bracket so the
first murder was to see the secondary

130
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:44,119
technically mister subtract in person
and i click here and pick a target of

131
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:52,769
said instead of trust this time it's
entrapped apply okay and then

132
00:13:52,769 --> 00:14:02,328
do one more else is equal to the Marines

133
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:09,969
square bracket to cause we're back and
we're going to click and this time we're

134
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:16,410
going to be clicking the multiplier
because we did add subtract multiply and

135
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,629
divide

136
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:27,329
target offset this time is for you
multiply 15 ok all right and now we need

137
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:32,729
to have one moment is gonna be out this
time so if every other option is false

138
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:40,069
then they must have chosen the divide
button so else colon in place now

139
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:47,708
quickly and this time we're going to
start offset to the divide simple y ok

140
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:52,808
right so now we've got out if statements
are based on what the user selected this

141
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:59,318
time we're going to either add subtract
multiply or divide if it is finished

142
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:03,969
running we're going to eat five button
again outside of a sore back on the

143
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:12,749
first line 59 rather upset 25 again he
got there because I copied that previous

144
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:20,459
previous five calculation 5 click
another and then we're going to equal

145
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:30,048
sign us up said i target all set to the
equal sign apply ok we're going to

146
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:34,730
seventeen lines of code you can save
this so safe and this time we'll call it

147
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,058
felt to a second revision can't save it
and then let's give it a shot so we're

148
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:47,458
going to set up a merge and asked him
which murdered like I'm going to run the

149
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:54,568
script was given a shot what would you
like to do add subtract multiply divide

150
00:15:54,568 --> 00:16:05,159
let's go with multiple ok to take over
but couldn't find the image to the stop

151
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,110
on

152
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:40,920
down now seems to be struggling to find
stop its remove stop by before Markakis

153
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:53,620
we know that works as the back in
multiple I K

154
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:02,490
found a stop on typing calculator
calculator five times five equals 25
