=================================
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,509
welcome to school the Exeter number for
additional living in this video we

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,859
looking at repeat tasks and automating
definitely extremely useful for making

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:15,138
box for games or pitting mundane tasks
everybody all sliders anchored available

4
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:19,489
no description but start with a couple
of nice features that collects has to

5
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:19,989
offer

6
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:24,368
first we have global hotkeys we can
listen for a certain hockey press to

7
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:28,099
change without script is doing or about
automation is running indefinitely and

8
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:34,070
we wanted to stop TX also provides us
with a large number of settings to

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,488
modify the behavior school TX the main
settings you may want to use his

10
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,439
movements delay which is the time taken
to move from the current mouse position

11
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:50,250
to the next mouse position but if this
is half a second or 0.5% scan rate which

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,558
is the amount of time between each
screens can for functions like white but

13
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:00,409
a photo checks about three times a
second and the labor for mass down which

14
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:05,088
is the time before a massive clicked
after moving to a quick location by the

15
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:09,950
photo it's half a second heavyset is
very 20 it will only be instant on the

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,840
next click it will then reset back to
hospice second if you want to continue

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,118
having a fast clip repeatedly said this
20 alright the folder the folder be used

18
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,250
to repeat kurd a specific number of
times this could be a set number like 50

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,118
all the items in a list in these two
examples we fest repeat some task five

20
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:37,140
times and in the second example we click
H patent in the list let's continue with

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,810
a calculator automation environment and
create a script that adds 15 times with

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,509
a folder with a modified his father in
our next example alright let's come over

23
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,170
to suck oily alright so that's come over
to securely and will copy lol original

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:08,709
data card we really need to copy is fast
is fast 34 sorry copy paste right so the

25
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,319
first thing we want to do is try setting
our master latest on defense

26
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:24,888
your settings and turn red with a
capital S dog move math delay with each

27
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,709
word that in the capital we want to make
that a goal to something different so

28
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,989
what we do is we could set that 20 and
this means that all it'll move instantly

29
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,900
across the screen you won't even see it
moves so you could make it must lower so

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,340
he could set to say one take one second
to move between each post on the screen

31
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:52,090
let's try 144 shop right let's create a
helpful at this time so we're going to

32
00:02:52,090 --> 00:03:05,519
fall step in range open parenthesis 5
close parenthesis callin callin once

33
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,859
again indicates that we're gonna go and
indent 1 so everything that's intended

34
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:15,659
is going to get repeated alright so what
we're going to do is going to click +

35
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:21,568
and one so actually what we want to do
before this is when I click 14 we do

36
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:34,388
anything to copy this place down to
click and when I said its target offset

37
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:46,449
214 I came and we can copy this whole
line here is we gon be using it a couple

38
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:52,359
times and pasted inside a folder and
want to change the target all set in

39
00:03:52,359 --> 00:04:04,099
this one to the possible but OK and then
on our next line inside of a fully we're

40
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:10,339
going to click one button again so we're
going to click on an entire fall it

41
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,319
would be a plus one plus one plus one
plus one extra as many times in our

42
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,968
range alright so once we're done with
all those places we're going to come

43
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:26,709
outside of a fully and we're going to
click the equal sign

44
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:36,329
get a final answer all set and gonna be
equal sign fly ok right so now we've got

45
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,089
a new program so we set out on mountain
move mouse to lay off to a better start

46
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:48,299
out for everything and move it normal
pace like before until we get to a

47
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,329
folder and everything will slow down so
you can see it repeating over and over

48
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:59,279
again and actually what we can do is we
could move this will put at the start

49
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,989
about document will leave one that and
another one at the top of the document

50
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,900
will make it instant actually no one
that will make it instant once we're

51
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:15,329
doing our calculations so we've got to
see the mass moving really slow there's

52
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:22,120
a quick stop such as and then moves on
to the calculated Press 1980 really fast

53
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,110
growing 00 well sorry one plus one plus
one equals like a cold so let's say this

54
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:38,669
this time we'll call this one calc three
and save i think is that right

55
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:45,758
let's give it a run run it'll move
really slowly quick start calc really

56
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,819
slowly back over to the bond that really
quickly and you can see just jumping

57
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:55,860
straight between the two and repeated
five times to get six for the first time

58
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:04,460
then added 15 times and hit a cozy up
six so far it's working correctly it

59
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:14,598
repeated five times never took it while
lives the Wallabies used for repeating a

60
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:17,339
block of code until a boolean expression
is false

61
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,689
so while the expression is true keep
repeating occurred

62
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:25,529
it's pretty simple commonly we use this
with the exists function as a returns

63
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:31,329
true or false even image exists right
but more of a script to repeat in the

64
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,408
add one forever and stop running the
script when we pass a global hotkey

65
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:40,180
alright so come back over and we heard
in writing

66
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:53,500
and we will remove a mass amounts to lay
just leave it as the default of 0.5% up

67
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,250
a global hotkey

68
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,060
to do this we're going to keep
everything we got here but we're gonna

69
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,970
get down a bit

70
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,100
we're going to create a boolean variable
cold running third called running and

71
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,050
it's gonna equal true capital T

72
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:17,870
so yes a program is running right now
we're going to define a function so it's

73
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,629
time to get a little bit more into the
advanced programming him but essentially

74
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:27,060
it's we use the death keywords to find a
function which is a block of cards we

75
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:36,639
want to run and will call it run cookie
and inside there were going to passing

76
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,740
the event and this is what is passed in
by a hot key binding so you can use it

77
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,478
if you wish but we're not going to be
using the event bearable ok so inside a

78
00:07:49,478 --> 00:08:02,319
function we're going to go about global
global variable running and we're going

79
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:10,019
to set running to echo the capital F so
this is when this current runs were

80
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,728
going to stop the program and the reason
we need this is for our next lines

81
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:19,329
outside of our function we're going to
use env for environment which will turn

82
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:29,538
red dot had in lowercase capital hates
the hotkey

83
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:34,490
been currencies and the key we're going
to listen which can be anything you like

84
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:43,479
but I'm going to use key don't f 12 the
f1 key and key modifier is going to be

85
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,920
the Ctrl key so we're gonna have to hold
control and then press f1 key

86
00:08:49,919 --> 00:09:02,328
modified modifier to turn red as well
don't control ctrl capitals come up and

87
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:11,819
then we're going to run the function Ron
what key close up a parenthesis alright

88
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,220
so whenever we passed that that hockey
f1 Kontrol f1 it will do our run hockey

89
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,028
function so tell running to be false

90
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:29,139
all right now it's set up a hooky we can
come down to a look

91
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:36,278
gonna leave everything else is it is
going to calculate and what we'll do is

92
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:40,820
let's remove this one originally so it
doesn't actually click one to start with

93
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:48,440
and instead of 40 gonna do is going to
have a while so we can remove this for

94
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:55,850
him and instead we're going to have a
while in lowercase exists so we're going

95
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:03,350
to use the exists function and while
exists and that calculator so I

96
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:18,560
calculated from up here but I think
while exists calculator and running

97
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,588
calculator is on screen

98
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:34,899
currently running we're going to keep
adding alright so that's really all we

99
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,399
need to change that while it is
repeating just like a full of is by

100
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:46,700
adding one and he set up to tell running
to stop being church which using the end

101
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:54,350
keyword it will cancel out is this still
exists but I running doesn't so that

102
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:04,580
both not sure and it will accept a
program an idol for us ok so let's save

103
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:13,050
and give it a shot so would you choose

104
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:25,039
run stock coke plus one and it will keep
going indefinitely you sit here and

105
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:34,789
watch it as long as we like to keep
adding some past five and he's going on

106
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:51,029
40 and then we can hold a control key
press f1 and Kansas and its 1000 work

107
00:11:51,029 --> 00:12:01,629
successfully ok just to keep in mind and
watch out for 60 you lou has a way to

108
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:06,129
stop getting stuck in an infinite loop
which can be painful as it has control

109
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:10,000
over your mouth and sometimes your
keyboard try to avoid it with things

110
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,580
like a hockey like in our example or
using the exists function on a window

111
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,000
that can be all effort to be closed

112
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,799
also there's lots of visuals changing
remember to use the white or exists to

113
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,500
be certain things you want to click is
actually visible ok that's it for this

114
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,210
video we can now repeat task and use
global hotkeys in the next video will be

115
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,139
putting everything together to create a
simple automation scripts that will play

116
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,659
the free click again clicking heroes you
have any questions leave it in the

117
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,269
comments and I'll try to answer as best
as possible don't forget to subscribe

118
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,269
thanks for watching
